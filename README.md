C project
 
SUDOKU project was created as a school project - developing easy small game.

The game is supposed to be played using keyboard.
To acces to the different positions in the table - user is putting the indexes of square he wants to input the number into.

The rules are same as any other rules for sudoku game.
Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces.
Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.
 
Player is able to choose the size of the game board, and also save his game into the textfile after the game.

Enjoy your game! :)
